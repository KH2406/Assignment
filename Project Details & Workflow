Project Details and Workflow

This project focuses on solving the problem of cart abandonment by segmenting users into meaningful groups and scoring them for re-engagement. The goal is to help marketers identify which users are most likely to convert if targeted with the right campaign.

1. Dataset Creation
Since no real data was available, I simulated a dataset of 5,000 users with realistic attributes such as:
- Average order value (AOV)
- Engagement score
- Profitability score
- Number of sessions in the last 30 days
- Cart abandonment date and last order date

Around 20% of users were marked as having abandoned a cart in the last 14 days, and the universe of interest was filtered to those who abandoned in the last 7 days.

2. MECE Segmentation

Users are segmented into buckets based on:
- AOV: Low, Mid, High
- Engagement: Low, Medium, High
- Profitability: Low, High

This ensures a MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) segmentation. Very small segments are merged up into parent groups, and overly large ones are split for balance.

3. Scoring and Ranking
Each segment is scored using multiple factors:
- Conversion potential (engagement × recency)
- Expected lift (simulated uplift from marketing)
- Profitability
- Strategic fit (based on AOV percentile)
- Segment size (normalized)

These are combined into an overall weighted score so segments can be ranked by priority.

4. Agent Wrapper (LangChain-style)

To make the workflow interactive, I built a simple agent wrapper with a prompt box.
A user types a natural language prompt (e.g., “Segment users with AOV [1000,3000] and engagement [0.4,0.7]”).
The backend runs the segmentation and scoring logic with those parameters.

Results are written to files:
agent_summary.csv – segment-level summary
agent_segmented.csv – user-level segment assignments
agent_segments.json – JSON version for integration
