# Assignment
The repo consist of all the code files and output files generated. I've also included the sample dataset which was generated for 5,000 users. 
The repo also contains files that explain the complete workflow and the procedure to execute the code on google colab (note that this step would require an openrouter api key) 

Model Used: Mistral 7B Instruct (via OpenRouter API)
Reason for selecting this model: lightweight, instruction-tuned, free to access via OpenRouter, good for running simple agent tasks.
